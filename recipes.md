Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 350ÂºF. Spray a 9" x 5" loaf pan with cooking spray.
2. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, kosher salt, and cinnamon; set aside.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until pale, approximately one minute. Add in melted butter, mashed banana, buttermilk/plain yogurt/sour cream, and vanilla and whisk until thoroughly combined.
4. Add the flour mixture to the egg/banana mixture and stir until all of the flour is just moistened. The batter will be lumpy and thick. Fold in desired toppings/add-ins. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
5. Bake for 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack.
